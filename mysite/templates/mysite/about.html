            <p>Innovation is led by those who know their stuff, whether it's the first job of their life or the latest project in a career decades in the making. In ARP, innovation depends not only on brilliant individuals, but also how they are disovered.  I've been fortunate to be part of a team working on a project dedicated to automating the recruitment process. In my capacity, I utilized state-of-the-art technologies such natural language processing with large language models, to boost the effectiveness of selecting candidates.</p>
